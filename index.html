            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate computer
                 science enthusiast who lives and breathes technology. From the very first time I wrote a line of code, I knew this was my calling. Iâ€™m driven by the endless possibilities of programming â€” whether it's building powerful web apps, solving complex algorithms, or exploring emerging technologies like AI and cloud computing. I believe that great things happen when logic meets creativity. I'm constantly learning, improving, and pushing the limits of what I can do. For me, Computer Science isn't just a subject â€” it's a way of thinking, solving, and innovating</p>
